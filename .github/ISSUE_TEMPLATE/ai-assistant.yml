        ## üöÄ What happens next?
        
        1. **AI Analysis**: The assistant will analyze your request and determine if repository context is needed
        2. **Context Gathering**: If needed, relevant code files will be automatically analyzed
        3. **Response Generation**: A comprehensive, technical response will be generated
        4. **Follow-up**: The AI can continue the conversation if you have additional questions
        
        ## üí° Tips for Better Responses
        
        **Be Specific**: Instead of "Why isn't this working?", try "The login function returns undefined when I call it with valid credentials"
        
        **Include Context**: Mention what you're building, what technologies you're using, and what you've already tried
        
        **Use Examples**: Provide code snippets, error messages, or expected vs. actual behavior
        
        **Ask Follow-ups**: Don't hesitate to ask for clarification or dive deeper into specific aspects
        
        ## üîß Example Good Requests
        
        **Code Question:**
        ```
        Type: Question / How-to
        Question: How can I implement user authentication in this React app? I want to use JWT tokens and need to protect certain routes. I see there's already a context system set up but I'm not sure how to integrate auth.
        Relevant Files: src/context/UserContext.js, src/components/Router.jsx
        Context: Standard
        ```
        
        **Bug Investigation:**
        ```
        Type: Bug Investigation  
        Question: The image carousel component stops working after navigating back from another page. The slides don't advance automatically and clicking next/prev buttons has no effect.
        Relevant Files: src/components/Carousel.jsx, src/hooks/useAutoplay.js
        What I've Tried: Added console logs, checked for memory leaks, tried remounting the component
        Context: Deep
        ```
        
        **Architecture Guidance:**
        ```
        Type: Architecture Guidance
        Question: I need to add real-time notifications to the app. Should I use WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, or polling? The app needs to handle ~1000 concurrent users and notifications aren't super frequent.
        Context: Standard
        Priority: Medium
        ```
