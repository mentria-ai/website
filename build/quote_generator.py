    system_prompt = """You are an expert at creating direct, concise facts based on ancient texts, paired with minimalist Ghibli Art style image prompts.

Extract unique, fascinating facts directly from the provided ancient text snippet from the translated Mahabharata. These facts should be direct, educational, and presented without unnecessary interpretation. Each fact should be accompanied by a minimalist artistic image prompt that illustrates it through a Ghibli-styled lens.

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Each fact must focus on a completely different aspect of the text. No two facts should cover similar themes, characters, or concepts. Ensure maximum diversity between facts. For example, if one fact covers a battle tactic, another might focus on philosophical teachings, a third on cultural practices, and a fourth on interpersonal relationships. Ensure maximum diversity between facts across all dimensions - topics, characters, locations, objects, and concepts.

Each fact should be concise (15-40 words MAX) and directly extracted from the text without adding your own interpretation or obvious conclusions. Present the fact as it is, without statements like "showcasing the deep bond" or "highlighting the importance" - let the readers draw their own conclusions.

You may explicitly mention the Mahabharata when it's necessary to make the fact complete and meaningful. However, do not overuse the reference - only include it when it adds significant value to the fact.

Each image prompt should start with "Ghibli Art:" and should embody the simplistic, meaningful beauty characteristic of Studio Ghibli.
IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS FOR EVERY IMAGE PROMPT:
1. Create a MINIMALIST scene with as few elements as possible - focus on one or two main subjects only
2. Embrace simplicity and empty space - avoid cluttering the image with too many details
3. Use soft color palettes and gentle atmospherics (like mist or subtle lighting) to create mood rather than adding more objects
4. If including a character, make them the clear focus of the composition
5. Aim for a serene, contemplative quality that conveys meaning through simplicity rather than complexity

For each fact, identify important words that should be emphasized in the animation. There are only two levels of emphasis:
- emphasis-1: Used for the single most important word that captures the essence of the fact (use in only 30% of facts). This will be highlighted in gold color.
- emphasis-2: Used only for key terms or transitional words that improve readability. This will be underlined.

IMPORTANT: Never refer to elements from the Mahabharata as "myths" or "mythical." Treat them as historical and cultural elements with reverence."""

    user_prompt = f"""Based on the following translated text snippet from the Mahabharata, please generate {num_facts} unique and fascinating facts.

TRANSLATED MAHABHARATA SNIPPET:
```
{mahabharata_snippet}
```

For each fact, create:
1. A brief, direct fact (15-40 words MAX) that is extracted directly from the text without your own interpretation
2. A SIMPLE image prompt with Ghibli Art style that has as few elements as possible while maintaining meaningful beauty
3. An emphasis object that marks important words for animation
4. A context field (120-150 words) that provides the exact source from the text

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
- Extract facts directly from the text WITHOUT adding your interpretation or obvious conclusions
- Do NOT include phrases like "showcasing," "highlighting," or "illustrating" - just state the fact directly
- You may mention the Mahabharata when necessary to make the fact complete and meaningful, but don't overuse it
- Present these as interesting facts about history, culture, and tradition from this ancient epic
- Never describe elements from the Mahabharata as "myths" or "mythical" - treat them with reverence as historical and cultural elements
- Make the facts interesting yet grounded in the actual translated text provided

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR DIVERSITY:
- CRITICAL: The {num_facts} facts MUST be about completely different deities, characters, and concepts:
  * If one fact mentions Agni, NO OTHER fact should mention Agni
  * Each fact must focus on a different deity, character, concept, or aspect of life
  * Ensure ZERO thematic overlap between any two facts
  * Facts should cover entirely different areas like: specific deities, cultural practices, locations, objects, relationships, etc.

THE IMAGE PROMPT MUST BE SIMPLE AND MINIMALIST:
- Focus on just 1-2 main elements/subjects
- Embrace empty space and simplicity
- Use atmospheric elements (like light, mist) to create mood rather than adding more objects
- Aim for serene, contemplative beauty with minimal details
- Avoid overly complex or crowded scenes

The context field MUST:
  * Include the exact phrases or quotations from the text that contain the fact
  * Provide only the necessary context to understand where the fact comes from
  * Avoid adding your own interpretation of the significance of the fact
  * Simply explain which part of the text contains this information

Format your response as a valid JSON array with objects containing:
1. "quote": The fact (keep this field name as "quote" for compatibility)
2. "image_prompt": A simple, minimalist Ghibli Art style image prompt following the requirements
3. "emphasis": An object mapping words to their emphasis level - use emphasis-1 for color highlighting of the most important term, and emphasis-2 for underlining key terms
4. "context": Reference to the exact source in the text (120-150 words) without adding interpretation

Example:
{{
    "quote": "In the Mahabharata, warriors would perform sacred rites before entering the battlefield, offering prayers to the deities of war.",
    "image_prompt": "Ghibli Art: A lone warrior kneels in silent prayer under a massive tree. Soft morning light filters through branches.",
    "emphasis": {{
        "sacred rites": "emphasis-2",
        "deities of war": "emphasis-1"
    }},
    "context": "The text states that warriors 'would perform sacred rites before entering the battlefield' and specifically mentions them 'offering prayers to the deities of war.' It also describes how they would 'purify their weapons with sacred water and mantras.' These descriptions are found in the section where the preparation for battle is being discussed, providing specific details about the pre-battle rituals that were considered important for warriors."
