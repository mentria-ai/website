    "lyrics": "[verse] The dawn spills ink on empty streets, / my coffee cup collects the heat. / The radio hums a half-remembered tune, / flickering like a drowsy moon. [chorus] Slow-motion shadows start to climb, / rewriting yesterday in pantomime. / I’ll press rewind just one more time— / but the tape’s been chewed by morning light. [verse] The crossword clues stay unresolved, / the cat yawns like a problem solved. / The fridge light buzzes its tiny elegy, / for all the groceries yet to be. [chorus] Slow-motion shadows start to climb, / rewriting yesterday in pantomime. / I’ll press rewind just one more time— / but the tape’s been chewed by morning light. [bridge] The toaster pops, a minor key, / the sun insists on symmetry. / I count the cracks along the ceiling— / oh, the art of fleeting feeling. [outro] The bus exhales and pulls away, / my reflection’s late to say: / We’ll try again another day. / (The cat just blinks and turns to sleep.)\n",
