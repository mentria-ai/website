[chorus] Static hums a lullaby, the city sighs in black and white. Were just echoes in the wires, flickering out before the light. [verse] Your voice still lingers on the tape, a whisper tangled in the spools. Rewind wont bring back our mistakes, just the ache of phantom rules. [chorus] Static hums a lullaby, the city sighs in black and white. Were just echoes in the wires, flickering out before the light. [bridge] Polaroids curl at the edges now, faces blurred by August heat. The future we swore to disavow still haunts this obsolete beat. [outro] The VHS whirs as it swallows the past, snow fills the screen at last.\n",
