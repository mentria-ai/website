        ## üéµ OctoBeats Music Generation Request
        
        Use this template to request music generation using OctoBeats Studio. The workflow will automatically generate music based on your parameters and create a pull request with the result.
        
        **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**
        - Only repository owners, admins, and maintainers can request music generation
        - The OctoBeats server must be running on the self-hosted runner
        - Music generation typically takes 12-35 seconds depending on quality mode
        - Generated files will be saved to `build/radio/assets/audios/` directory

        ## üîÑ What happens next?
        
        1. **Validation**: The workflow will check if you have the required permissions and if the issue has the correct labels
        2. **Parameter Extraction**: Your parameters will be extracted and validated
        3. **Server Check**: The ACE-Step server status will be verified
        4. **Audio Generation**: Your audio will be generated using the specified parameters
        5. **Branch & PR Creation**: A new branch will be created with the audio file and a pull request will be opened
        6. **Notification**: You'll receive a comment on this issue with the results and PR link

        ## üé≤ Reproducible Generation with Seeds
        
        Seeds enable you to:
        - **Recreate exact results**: Use the same seed to generate identical audio
        - **A/B test prompts**: Compare different prompts with the same random state
        - **Version control**: Track and reproduce specific generations
        - **Share reproducible results**: Others can recreate your exact audio using the same parameters and seed
        
        **Note**: The seed will be included in the generated metadata and PR description for future reference.
        
        ## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
        
        If the workflow fails, check:
        - OctoBeats server is running on `localhost:8000`
        - You have the required repository permissions
        - The issue has the `audio` or `octobeats` label
        - Parameters are within valid ranges (duration: 30-240s, seed: 0-4294967295)
