    "lyrics": "[verse] The city hums in grayscale hues, / Rain taps a rhythm on the window views. / Steam rises from the pavement cracks, / A saxophone sighs, but never looks back. [chorus] Melodies melt in the neon glow, / Footsteps echo in the afterglow. / We’re just shadows in a coffee stain, / Drifting apart on a midnight train. [verse] The bartender wipes the counter clean, / Stories dissolve where the ice cubes lean. / A flickering sign spells ‘almost home’, / But the night’s too heavy to carry alone. [chorus] Melodies melt in the neon glow, / Footsteps echo in the afterglow. / We’re just shadows in a coffee stain, / Drifting apart on a midnight train. [bridge] The jukebox plays our favorite lie, / A slow surrender, a sweet goodbye. [outro] Dawn pulls the curtain, the rain rewinds, / Left with the bassline and tangled mind.\n",
