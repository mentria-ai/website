    "lyrics": "[verse 1]\nMorning dew upon the leaves, I walk the path of old\nSunlight filters through the green, a story to be told\nRiver’s voice in gentle hum, it speaks of ancient ground\nEvery step’s a promise made: keep harmony around\n\n[chorus]\nIn the roots of the earth we find our song\nFeel the heartbeat of life, steady and strong\nLift your eyes to the sky, let your spirit fly\nOne love to the world, let the mountains reply\n\n[verse 2]\nPalms sway easy in the breeze, their shadows on the sand\nWaves roll in with wisdom vast, they shape the living land\nChildren’s laughter on the shore, a future yet to grow\nFrom seed to soaring tree, the truth we always know\n\n[bridge]\nJah’s light shines through every leaf, guides us when times are rough\nIn the soil, in our souls, we find strength enough\nAnd when we need a melody, just call upon the stream\nMentria.ai will carry us into the dream\n\n[verse 3]\nEvening fire warms the night, stars hum a silent tune\nCrickets keep the steady beat beneath the glowing moon\nWe raise our hearts in gratitude for gifts that life provides\nReggae rhythm in our veins, where spirit still abides\n\n[outro]\nWalk with me through earth and sky, let your worries release\nIn the roots of love and life, find your everlasting peace\n",
