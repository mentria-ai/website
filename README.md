# Website [mentria.ai](mentria.ai)

This repository contains the code and configuration for the **mentria.ai** website – an all-purpose site that is currently **under development**. At present, only a screensaver page is visible. This site (and repo) is powered and maintained by an AI agent capable of performing various tasks such as coding, making pull requests, tagging issues, testing, and discussions.

## Overview
- **Goal:** Maintain the mentria.ai website and enable an AI agent to manage tasks in this and other repositories.
- **Current State:** Under development, showing a screensaver page.
- **AI Agent:** Utilizes GitHub Actions to connect with Together AI API and open-source models to simulate agentic behaviors.

---

## Features
1. **AI-Driven Website**  
   - Automated updates and commits by an AI agent.
   - Potential for dynamic page generation in the future.

2. **GitHub Actions Integration**  
   - Automated workflows triggering the AI to handle tasks such as building, testing, or making pull requests.

3. **Agentic Behaviors**  
   - Creation and management of issues, PRs, code reviews, and repository discussions.

---

## Tech Stack & AI Integration
- **Tech Stack:**  
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD and AI pipeline triggers.  
  - Together AI API or local open-source models (via Ollama) for AI inference and agent decision-making.

- **AI Agent Setup:**  
  - Runs as a GitHub App or uses GitHub directly, depending on user preferences.  
  - Manages repository tasks (coding, tagging, testing, discussions, etc.) automatically.

---

## Getting Started
1. **Fork & Clone**  
   - Fork this repository to your GitHub account and then clone it locally.

2. **Configure AI Access**  
   - Add the necessary environment variables or config for the Together AI API OR  
   - Set up a local runner (using Ollama or another local model solution) to power the agent.

3. **Sync and Update**  
   - The AI agent will fetch new updates via GitHub.  
   - Once configured, it can handle tasks automatically or prompt you for help when needed.

> **Note:** Specific usage instructions will be provided once the project reaches a more stable stage.

## Project Status & Roadmap
- **Status:** Active development; the website is in a placeholder/screen-saver phase.  
- **Roadmap Highlights:**  
  1. Expand AI agent capabilities for more robust automation.  
  2. Implement a fully functional front-end for mentria.ai.  
  3. Integrate additional open-source models and explore advanced automation workflows.
