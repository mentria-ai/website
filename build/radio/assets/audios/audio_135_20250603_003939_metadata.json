    "lyrics": "[verse] The streetlights hum a lullaby / Asphalt still warm from the day / I trace the cracks in constellations / But the sky forgot my name [chorus] All my ghosts are out tonight / Dancing in the parking lot / If I close my eyes too tight / Maybe time will stop [verse] Your voice still echoes on the payphone / Static like a distant shore / I keep the quarters but dont call / Cant bear to hear you dont pick up anymore [chorus] All my ghosts are out tonight / Spinning under neon rain / If I hold my breath just right / Maybe youll remain [bridge] The diners fluorescent glow / Writes our story on the glass / Two silhouettes now / One shadow cast [outro] Let the dawn keep waiting / Let the traffic lights sway / Just one more cigarette / Before yesterday fades away\n",
