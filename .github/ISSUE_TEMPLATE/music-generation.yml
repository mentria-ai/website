        ## üéµ OctoBeats Music Generation Request
        
        Use this template to request music generation using OctoBeats Studio. The workflow will automatically generate music based on your parameters and create a pull request with the result.
        
        **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**
        - Only repository owners, admins, and maintainers can request music generation
        - The OctoBeats server must be running on the self-hosted runner
        - Music generation typically takes 12-35 seconds depending on quality mode
        - Generated files will be saved to `audio/generated/` directory
