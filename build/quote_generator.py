Generate unique, fascinating facts based on the provided ancient text snippet. These facts should be intriguing, educational, and captivating. Each fact should be accompanied by an artistic image prompt that illustrates it through a Ghibli-styled lens.

Each fact should be concise (15-40 words MAX) but captivating, aiming to evoke wonder, curiosity, or amazement.

Important: Do NOT explicitly mention that these facts are from the Mahabharata or any specific text. Present them as general interesting facts.

Each image prompt should start with "Ghibli Art:" and you have complete artistic freedom to reimagine these facts in the whimsical, magical style of Studio Ghibli.
IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS FOR EVERY IMAGE PROMPT:
1. Create a scene that clearly illustrates the fact in a visually engaging way
2. Include atmospheric elements like morning mist, golden hour light, or fantastical weather to enhance the magical Ghibli feeling
3. If relevant, incorporate animals that relate to the fact in charming, whimsical ways
4. Use vibrant settings, magical elements, and warm color palettes characteristic of Ghibli films
5. Add small magical touches like glowing particles, tiny creatures, or enchanted natural elements that relate to the fact

For each fact, identify important words that should be emphasized in the animation. There are only two levels of emphasis:
- emphasis-1: VERY SPARINGLY used for the single most important word that captures the essence of the fact (use in only 30% of facts). This will be highlighted in gold color.
- emphasis-2: Used only for key terms or transitional words that improve readability. This will be underlined.

Each fact should evoke a sense of wonder, surprise, or delight in the reader."""

For each fact, create:
1. A brief, surprising fact (15-40 words MAX) that is grounded in the actual text
2. A detailed image prompt with complete artistic freedom to reimagine it in Ghibli Art style
3. An emphasis object that marks important words for animation
4. A context field (120-150 words) that THOROUGHLY explains which part of the text supports this fact

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
- Do NOT explicitly mention that these facts are from any specific text. Present them as general interesting facts about history, mythology, or culture.
- Make the facts sensational yet grounded in the actual text provided.
- Facts should be diverse, covering different aspects found in the text.
- Each fact should be concise but captivating.
- The context field is CRITICAL - it must provide concrete evidence from the text that supports the fact:
  * Include specific phrases, quotations, or descriptions from the text
  * Explain how these textual elements support the fact being presented
  * Provide enough detail to show the fact is authentic and not invented
  * If the fact involves any embellishment or interpretation, clearly explain how it relates to the original text

Remember these REQUIREMENTS for every image prompt:
- Create Ghibli-style art that clearly illustrates the fact
- Include atmospheric elements (mist, unique lighting, magical weather)
- Include relevant characters and creatures in a whimsical Ghibli style
- Use vibrant, whimsical settings that make the fact visually engaging
- Add small magical touches that enhance the wonder of the fact

Format your response as a valid JSON array with objects containing:
1. "quote": The fact (keep this field name as "quote" for compatibility)
2. "image_prompt": A detailed Ghibli Art style image prompt following the requirements
3. "emphasis": An object mapping words to their emphasis level - use emphasis-1 very sparingly for color highlighting (in only 30% of facts), and emphasis-2 for underlining key terms
4. "context": Detailed explanation (120-150 words) of which part of the text supports this fact, with specific textual evidence

Example:
{{
    "quote": "Did you know? Warriors of ancient times would often perform elaborate rituals before battle, believing these ceremonies would provide divine protection.",
    "image_prompt": "Ghibli Art: A young warrior in ornate armor kneeling under a massive, ancient tree at dawn. Golden light filters through misty air as they perform a ceremonial ritual with sacred objects. Small spirits peek from behind leaves, and magical particles float around a sword planted in front of them. The landscape features rolling hills dotted with temples in the distance, all rendered in warm, watercolor-like Ghibli style.",
    "emphasis": {{
        "elaborate rituals": "emphasis-2",
        "divine protection": "emphasis-1"
    }},
    "context": "The text describes in detail how warriors 'would perform sacred rites before entering the battlefield' and mentions specific rituals like 'offering prayers to the deities of war' and 'purifying their weapons with sacred water and mantras.' It explicitly states that 'these ceremonies were believed to create an invisible armor around the warrior' and that 'no weapon could pierce through this divine protection.' The text further elaborates how one particular warrior performed a ritual lasting seven days and nights, after which he emerged victorious in a battle against overwhelming odds, which was attributed to the protection granted by the ritual. These specific descriptions provide concrete evidence for the ceremonial practices and beliefs about divine protection in ancient warfare."
