    "lyrics": "[verse] Neon signs hum in the key of B flat / Coffee steam curls like a smoky riff / You trace circles where the wax once sat / On a record skip that won’t let go if [chorus] The jukebox heart keeps skipping beats / Playing our song on repeat, repeat / Static love in a 4/4 frame / Drown the silence, say my name [verse] Your laughter’s pressed between the grooves / Side B’s where we left the proof / One last chorus, then the needle lifts / Leaving orbits adrift [bridge] Rewind the tape, it’s all hiss and ache / Even the ghosts need a break [outro] Fade to runway lights / Departure boards blink goodnight\n",
