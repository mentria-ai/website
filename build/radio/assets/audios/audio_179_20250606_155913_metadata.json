    "lyrics": "[verse] Neon signs hum in the rain / A flickering ghost of a memory lane / We used to dance under cathode glow / Now the screens just whisper low [chorus] Echoes in the static / Faces we can’t place / Time rewinds in fragments / But we can’t hit erase [verse] Your voice is trapped in a cassette / A love song lost in a pirate net / Rewind, but the tape’s too worn / Just a hiss where our names were sworn [chorus] Echoes in the static / Faces we can’t place / Time rewinds in fragments / But we can’t hit erase [bridge] Dial tone on a payphone heart / Every number leads to a different dark / The city breathes in binary sighs / And our story’s just a corrupted file [outro] Fading into the noise again / A VHS sky with a broken end / Press stop—but the play’s on loop / Just a ghost in the circuit of you\n",
